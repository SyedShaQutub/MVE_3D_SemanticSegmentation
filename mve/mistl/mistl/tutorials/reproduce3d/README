# program projects a 2D pixel into the 3D world
# 
#
#
# Given 2 images I1, I2 of the same scene, take with different cameras and
# the corresponding camera files (in *.ycam format) C1, C2.
# An image point P1 with corresponding coordinates in I1 and I2 (in general 
# not the same coordinates) will be projected into the world.
#
#
# ./reproduce3d camera1.ycam camera2.ycam <x-coord in I1> <y-coord in I1> <x-coord in I2> <y-coord in I2>
# e.g: ./reproduce3d camera1.ycam camera2.ycam 1897 1476 1866 1342
# 
#
# By adding the coordinates of another image point, a second point will be projected 
# into 3D space and the distance to the first one will be computed.
# ./reproduce3d camera1.ycam camera2.ycam <x-coord-P1 in I1> <y-coord-P1 in I1> <x-coord-P1 in I2> <y-coord-P1 in I2> <x-coord-P2 in I1> <y-coord-P2 in I1> <x-coord-P2 in I2> <y-coord-P2 in I2>
# e.g: ./reproduce3d camera1.ycam camera2.ycam 1862 1468 1831 1333 1897 1476 1866 1342
